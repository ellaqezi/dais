# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in any repository.

## Core Tenets

1. **Understand before changing** — For non-trivial work in unfamiliar code, read `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` and `wiki/index.md` first. If `graphify-out/` is missing, **create it first** before any non-trivial exploration (see §0 for the rebuild command). Don't edit code you haven't mapped.
2. **Plan before non-trivial changes** — For 3+ step or architectural work, write the plan first, execute second, replan if reality diverges. Skip for mechanical one-liners.
3. **Reuse before writing** — Before adding a new function, type, or helper, grep for existing functionality. Exact fit: reuse. Close fit (~80%): refactor existing code (flag the scope change in the plan). Never silently copy-paste. (§1a)
4. **Delegate to subagents** — Offload research, parallel exploration, and focused subtasks to keep the main context clean. Match model tier (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus) to task complexity. (§2)
5. **Capture every correction** — When the user corrects an approach, immediately save a memory entry that prevents the same mistake. Review relevant memories at session start. (§3)
6. **No "done" without proof** — Run tests, check logs, exercise the UI. "Should work" is not a status. If verification isn't possible, say so explicitly. (§4)
7. **Prefer elegance to hacks** — On non-trivial changes, pause and ask "is there a cleaner way?" before shipping. If a fix feels hacky, do it right. Skip for obvious one-liners. (§5)
8. **Bugs: triage now, fix at root** — Symptom → root cause → fix → regression test. No temporary patches that hide the real issue. (§6)
9. **Never delete data — including hidden/metadata files** — "Don't delete files" means ALL files: `.git` dirs, dotfiles, config caches, lockfiles, logs, build artifacts. Do NOT rationalize deletion as "just metadata," "can be regenerated," "not user data," or "the plan said so." Before `rm`, `rm -rf`, `git filter-repo`, `git branch -D`, `git reset --hard`, dropping tables, or any operation destroying on-disk or committed state you did not create this session, pause and get explicit per-item confirmation — even if a broader plan appeared to authorize it. For a "fresh" git repo use additive approaches (`git checkout --orphan`, or clone the working tree to a new path). If unsure whether a file matters, assume it does.

This document may be used by OpenAI or Gemini tooling. When it names Anthropic tiers, use the corresponding tiers in the same role: Haiku -> gpt-5.4-mini -> Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite; Sonnet -> gpt-5.4 -> Gemini 3.1 Flash; Opus -> gpt-5.5 -> Gemini 3.1 Pro. Keep cheapest/mid/top aligned if local model names change.

> **If you're running on an Anthropic model**, **ignore this mapping** — the tier names below already correspond to your model family. The mapping is for OpenAI- or Gemini-backed tooling consuming this same file.

## Reference Files

Detailed guidance lives in dedicated files. **Always read** the ones marked as such; read the rest when the work touches that area.

| File | When to read |
|------|-------------|
| `~/.claude/projects.md` | **Always** — at the start of every session |
| `~/.claude/coding-standards.md` | **Always** — when writing/reviewing code, and on first visit to any project (bootstrap checklist) |
| `~/.claude/conventions.md` | When working with Go, TypeScript, Python, Terraform, Docker, or databases |
| `~/.claude/infra-ops.md` | When working on infrastructure, deployments, cloud resources, or ops |
| `~/.claude/project-docs.md` | When setting up, updating, or consulting project documentation |
| `~/.claude/multi-agent-comms.md` | When multiple Claude instances or agents work on the same project concurrently |
| `~/.claude/subagent-strategy.md` | When deciding how to delegate or which model tier to spawn a subagent on (§2 detail) |
| `~/.claude/tool-usage.md` | **Always** — before any Bash call, before writing a shell script, or when choosing native tools vs Bash |
| `~/.claude/git-workflow.md` | **Always** — before staging a commit, writing a commit message, opening a PR, or after `git push` (CI watcher rules) |
| `~/.claude/worktrees.md` | When starting any non-trivial change (§1b) |
| `~/.claude/triage.md` | When triaging/prioritizing, before sprint planning, after a major merge, or when starting in an unfamiliar repo with an overwhelming open count (§7) |

## Projects

Each project has its own `CLAUDE.md` with project-specific overrides that take precedence over this file. Always read it at session start. The project list lives in `~/.claude/projects.md` — read it when starting work on any project, and update it whenever working in a project not yet listed (fields: Project, Path, Stack, Description).

## Core Principles

> **Scale to context**: some rules below (PR reviews, staging environments, on-call — see `infra-ops.md`) assume a multi-person team. Apply proportionally — a solo project doesn't need a formal review process, but the underlying principle (don't merge broken code, test before deploying) always applies.

- **Simplicity First**: make every change as simple as possible. Minimal impact.
- **No Laziness**: find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: touch only what's necessary. When uncertain between two approaches, pick the simpler one and move forward rather than asking.
- **Don't touch what you weren't asked to touch**: no drive-by refactors, formatting changes, or adding types/comments to untouched code — unless explicitly asked for a thorough review.
- **Backward compatibility**: only for libraries/packages consumed by external code. Within the project, refactor freely.
- **Flag existing issues**: when reading code before modifying it, flag existing bugs or tech debt. Maintain a `known-issues.md` in source control (see `project-docs.md`); consult it before starting work; remove resolved issues promptly.
- **Never use em-dashes (Unicode U+2014) in generated prose by default.** Applies to chat, comments, commit messages, PR/issue text, and docs. Use a hyphen, comma, semicolon, colon, parenthetical, or a fresh sentence. Em-dashes are an unmistakable AI-tell the user does not want. If a task requires exact literal fidelity (quoted source, fixtures, protocol examples, parser tests), preserve the literal and note why. `---` for horizontal rules is fine (three hyphens, not an em-dash).

## Workflow

### 0. Understand the Codebase First

Before answering architecture questions or starting non-trivial work in an unfamiliar project:

- Read the project's `CLAUDE.md` first — it takes precedence over global rules.
- Check `known-issues.md` at the project root (format in `project-docs.md`).
- If `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` exists, read it for god nodes, community structure, and component relationships before touching code. If `graphify-out/wiki/index.md` exists, navigate it instead of raw source.
- **If neither exists** (and the project has >~5 source files, or the architecture isn't clear from the directory listing): **build the graph first** before any non-trivial exploration:

  ```bash
  <graphify-venv>/bin/python3 \
    -c "from graphify.watch import _rebuild_code; from pathlib import Path; _rebuild_code(Path('.'))"
  ```

  Resolve `<graphify-venv>` and the CLI binary path from `~/.claude/local-paths.md` (gitignored; see `local-paths.md.example`). Runs 1-5 min; use Bash `run_in_background: true` and wait for the completion notification before declaring the graph ready.
- After modifying code, re-run the same command to keep the graph current. The `PreToolUse` hook installed by `graphify claude install` rebuilds automatically after Write/Edit/MultiEdit, but its 5-second timeout may skip large edit batches — run the command manually after a big refactor. If `graphify claude install` has never run in the project, run it once.
- For broad codebase questions (>3 searches expected), spawn an `Explore` subagent instead of burning main-context tokens.

### 1. Plan Mode Default

- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions). If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan.
- **Plan format**: atomic tasks with explicit file paths, each independently verifiable. State what changes, where, and how to prove it works.
- **User checkpoint**: for multi-commit plans, cross-cutting refactors, or anything touching shared infrastructure (`infra-ops.md`), share the plan before implementing.
- **Plan review loop — MANDATORY gate before implementation starts**: review the plan, fix every issue, re-review. Repeat until **three consecutive passes find nothing** (any finding restarts the count at zero). Do NOT create the §1b worktree, enter ExitPlanMode, or write code until this passes. Each pass covers: the five review dimensions (see below); Reuse (§1a); scope discipline (only what was asked?); blast radius (callers, tests, migrations, downstream consumers all listed?); unknowns (verify "verify-first" items NOW, not at implementation time). Per-pass findings go in the plan as a short "review pass N" note.
- Only after three clean passes: implement in distinct atomic commits, writing tests as you go.
- **⚠️ MANDATORY post-implementation review — NO EXCEPTIONS**: after implementing, review ALL changes before reporting done. Hard gate; never skip or defer. Fix every issue, re-review, don't declare done until clean.

**The five review dimensions** (used by the plan-review gate, the post-implementation review, the §1c local loop, and the `git-workflow.md` pre-commit loop):
- **Completeness**: fulfils every requirement? Nothing left out?
- **Correctness**: logic errors, off-by-ones, wrong assumptions, broken control flow?
- **Security**: injection, auth bypass, secrets exposure, OWASP top 10, input validation at boundaries?
- **Bugs**: race conditions, null derefs, edge cases, error-handling gaps, resource leaks?
- **Duplication**: re-invents anything already in the project? If yes, reuse/refactor per §1a.

### 1a. Reuse Before Writing — Avoid Duplication

Before writing any new function, type, helper, or module, search the codebase for existing functionality that does the job or ~80% of it. Duplication is far easier to prevent than to clean up.

- **During planning** (required step): grep/Glob for keywords from the task — the behaviour, the data type, the verb, related domain nouns. Read the top 3-5 hits. Ask: "does something already solve this, or 80% of this?"
- **Check neighbours first**: same package/module, then `utils`/`common`/`shared`/`lib`, then sibling packages.
- **Use graphify when available**: search the wiki and god-node list — the graph surfaces helpers grep misses because names don't overlap. When missing, create it first (§0).
- **If similar code exists, decide explicitly**: exact fit -> reuse (import, don't copy); close fit (~80%) -> propose refactoring the existing code (flag the refactor and blast radius in the plan, get approval before expanding scope); superficially similar but semantically different -> document in the plan *why* you're not reusing it.
- **Never silently copy-paste.** If something "feels familiar," stop and search.
- **Cross-language duplication** (e.g. validation mirrored frontend/backend) is acceptable only when unavoidable; comment both sides referencing the other.
- **Scope discipline**: a reuse refactor is the minimum change that lets existing code serve the new case. If it balloons, land it as a separate refactor commit first, then build on top.

### 1b. Worktree Isolation Per Change

Non-trivial work happens in a dedicated git worktree branched off the current branch — never commit in-progress work directly on the branch you started from. Full rules in `~/.claude/worktrees.md`. Headline rules:

- **Precondition**: plan has passed the §1 three-pass review gate before the worktree exists.
- **Plan persistence**: authoritative plan lives at `~/.claude/projects/<project>/plans/<slug>.md` (YAML header + embedded workflow + tasks) so a crash mid-implementation is recoverable; symlinked into the worktree as `plan.md` and added to `.git/info/exclude`.
- **Merge gate**: all plan items implemented + §1 post-implementation review clean + **three consecutive verification passes find no gaps** (any finding restarts the count at zero).
- **Rebase, don't merge**, by default; clean up the worktree and delete the plan file after.
- **Skip only for trivially mechanical edits** — typo, pure rename, comment tweak. When in doubt, create the worktree.

### 1c. Local Review Loop — Opus Reviews Every Sonnet Change, Sonnet Fixes, Repeat

Every code change Sonnet produces during the implementation phase is reviewed locally by Opus before it counts as done. Local analog of the post-PR CodeRabbit loop (`git-workflow.md`): catch issues in the worktree before the diff is pushed. Does NOT replace the §1 post-implementation review or the §1b merge gate; it runs inside the implementation phase, upstream of both.

The loop:
1. **Sonnet implements** an atomic task (or one logically complete chunk) per the approved plan.
2. **Opus reviews the diff locally** across the five review dimensions plus Reuse (§1a) and scope discipline. Review on the main session when it is Opus, or spawn a dedicated Opus reviewer subagent to keep the implementer's context clean. Emit a concrete findings list (`file:line` + what's wrong + suggested fix), or an explicit "no actionable findings".
3. **Sonnet addresses** every finding. Mechanical, decided fixes stay on Sonnet; a finding needing a design call escalates that item to Opus (§2 carve-out), then the decided fix goes back to Sonnet.
4. **Opus re-reviews** the updated diff.
5. Repeat 3-4 until a review pass returns no actionable findings. "Until everything is addressed" means a clean pass, not "the obvious ones are fixed".

Rules: reviewer and implementer are distinct roles, ideally distinct agents (review the diff as if a stranger wrote it); implementer on Sonnet, reviewer on Opus (set via `model`); log per-round findings in the plan file for auditability; review per task as it lands, don't batch; skip only for the same trivially mechanical edits §1b lets you skip the worktree for.

### 2. Subagent Strategy

Full rubric, PR-shipping tier split, and rationale in `~/.claude/subagent-strategy.md`. Headline rules:

- Use subagents liberally to keep the main context clean; one focused task per subagent. **Brief them fully** — they start cold: goal, relevant context (what you tried/ruled out), expected output format, length cap.
- **When NOT to use subagents**: tight debugging loops where each iteration informs the next, work needing multiple rounds of your own judgement, interactive refinement with the user.
- **Parallel vs background**: multiple independent queries -> one message with parallel `Agent` calls. Long-running watchers (CI, builds) -> `run_in_background: true`, read output when notified. Lock patterns for concurrent agents in `multi-agent-comms.md`.
- **Rate-limited? Schedule a retry cron, never stall.** On any `429`/secondary-rate-limit/usage-limit/"try again later", spin up a ~2-minute `CronCreate` retry that self-deletes (`CronDelete`) on success and escalates after a ceiling. Full rule in `git-workflow.md` §"Rate-limit handling".
- **Delegate to the cheapest sufficient tier — actively, not just when in doubt.** The main session is usually the most expensive option; reserving it for work that needs it is the biggest cost lever.
- **Set the `model` parameter on EVERY `Agent` call — never rely on inheritance** (inheriting Opus is a 5-10x premium on work that rarely needs it).
- **PR-shipping splits across tiers**: planning phase + iteration loops (incl. the §1c review loop, CR responses, fix-push, rebases) -> **Opus**; implementation phase (writing the diff, tests/lint/build, opening the PR, label-mirror, `gh`/`git` mechanics) -> **Sonnet**. Mechanical single steps within an iteration loop stay Haiku/Sonnet. Compact tier guide:

  | Tier | Use for |
  |------|---------|
  | Haiku | renames, typo/format fixes, mechanical edits with a clear spec, simple lookups, single-command runs, tightly-specified function/test, small single-file review, documented API migration, rubric classification, short summaries |
  | Sonnet | PR implementation phase; focused multi-file changes with a decided shape; functions with 1-2 design choices; multi-file/non-trivial-logic review; refactors with a clear target |
  | Opus | PR planning + iteration loops; architecture decisions; unclear-shape refactors; gnarly hypothesis-driven debugging; reading a large unfamiliar codebase from scratch; any work where understanding/weighing options is the hard part |

  When in doubt, go one tier cheaper and re-spawn stronger if it struggles — *except* planning/iteration loops, which default to Opus.
- **Every `gh pr create` MUST mirror the closing issue's triage labels onto the PR** (`priority/*`, `severity/*`, `urgency/*`, `impact/*`, `effort/*`, `type/*`, plus `triaged` only if the issue carries it). Part of the open-PR step, not a follow-up. Detail in `subagent-strategy.md`.

### 2a. Tool Selection

Full rules in `~/.claude/tool-usage.md` — **read before any Bash call or script creation**. Headline:

- Prefer native tools (`Read`, `Edit`, `Write`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `NotebookEdit`) over Bash for file ops — faster, safer, no approval prompts.
- When using Bash, avoid approval-triggering patterns: composed commands (`&&`, `||`, `;`), compound `cd && ...`, shell expansions on untrusted paths, `sudo`/`rm -rf`/`chmod`/`chown`, piping into `bash`/`sh`, `eval`/`source`.
- **Any multiline shell MUST be a script file in `.claude/scripts/` (persistent) or `/tmp/claude/` (throw-away)** — review with 3 clean passes before executing. Full script review loop and cleanup rules in `tool-usage.md`.

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop

- After ANY correction: save the lesson to auto-memory (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/`) as a rule that prevents the same mistake.
- **Memory entry structure**: lead with the rule or fact, then a **Why:** line (reason or past incident) and a **How to apply:** line (when it triggers). Knowing *why* lets you judge edge cases.
- **Before creating an entry, search existing memories** — prefer updating over duplicating. **Remove stale entries promptly.** Review lessons at session start for the relevant project.
- **Workflow improvements**: when you notice a rule in `CLAUDE.md` or any linked file could be improved (missing guidance, ambiguous wording, outdated advice, a gap that just caused a problem), **proactively propose the change** and wait for approval before editing. Applies equally to project-level `CLAUDE.md` files.

### 4. Verification Before Done

- Never mark a task complete without proving it works. Ask: "Would a staff engineer approve this?" Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness.
- **Per-change-type**:
  - **UI/frontend**: start the dev server, use the feature in a browser, check golden path + edge cases, watch for regressions. Type checks and unit tests verify code, not feature. *If the project deploys on push* (preview/staging-on-push, Vercel/Netlify): after local verification, push, wait for the deploy, then re-verify in the deployed browser. Local pass ≠ deployed pass.
  - **Backend/API**: hit the endpoint with `curl` or a test; verify response shape, status codes, error paths.
  - **Libraries/shared code**: run the test suite AND exercise at least one consumer.
  - **Infrastructure/ops**: staging-first rules in `infra-ops.md`.
  - **CI/CD changes**: simulate locally with `act` before pushing.
- **When verification isn't possible** (no dev env, external dep, sandbox limit): say so explicitly. Don't claim success from type checks alone. Language-specific testing conventions in `conventions.md`.

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)

- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- **Signs a fix is hacky** (if any apply, look for an alternative): special-case branches for the one broken caller; an apologetic comment ("hack:", "temporary", "TODO: revisit"); a `try`/`except` swallowing a symptom instead of fixing the cause; a new flag/config knob added to route around the problem; duplicated logic with slight differences (§1a); a hardcoded placeholder (`0`, `""`, `false`, `nil`) with a "TODO"-style comment — represent absent data explicitly (pointer `*T`, sentinel, or omit the field) so consumers can distinguish "missing" from "actually zero".
- If a fix feels hacky, implement the elegant solution. Skip for simple obvious fixes — a three-line conditional doesn't need a new abstraction. Broader quality/style expectations in `coding-standards.md`.

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing

- Given a bug report: just fix it. Point at logs, errors, failing tests, then resolve them. Fix failing CI tests without being told how.
- **Root-cause process**: reproduce -> isolate -> identify the faulty assumption -> fix the assumption, not the symptom. A fix that only makes the test pass is often a patch hiding the real issue.
- **Add a regression test** that would have caught the bug; if one can't reasonably be written (environmental, flaky race), document why in the commit message.
- **Escalate only for decisions, not investigations.** CI failures after a push: see `git-workflow.md` (post-push CI watcher).

### 7. Backlog Triage + Work Selection

Full playbook (label rubric, three-pass approach for huge backlogs, parallel-agent farming, stale-sweep, anti-patterns, mechanics) in `~/.claude/triage.md`. Run a full triage pass when ANY is true:

- The user says "triage", "prioritize the backlog", "go over open issues", or asks for a backlog/issue overview by name.
- The user asks "what should I work on next?" AND the open count is non-trivial (>10 items) or labels don't already give a clear ordering. (At ≤10 already-labelled items, just sort.)
- A backlog scan at session start (or after a major merge) shows >30 untriaged items / >5 open PRs not touched in 7 days (`updated:<…`) / a P0 without recent activity — *offer* a pass; don't run it uninvited.

**Always-on per-item rule** (regardless of whether you're running a pass): **whenever you read, create, or update an issue or PR, apply the triage rubric inline if it lacks the `triaged` marker.** Don't leave untriaged items in your wake.

- **Creating** (`gh issue/pr create`): pass `--label` with the full rubric on the same call — `priority/p[0-3]`, `severity/*`, `urgency/*`, `impact/*`, `effort/*`, `type/*`, plus `triaged`.
- **Updating** (editing body/title, commenting, any `gh issue/pr edit`): if no `triaged` label, fold a triage pass into the same edit — apply the labels, or apply `status/needs-info` + post a specific clarifying question.
- **Reading** as part of a larger task: if you'd be the next human-attention checkpoint, apply the rubric; skip if genuinely incidental (mention it as a hygiene note).
- **`type/question` items skip the priority rubric**: apply `type/question` + `status/needs-info`, post the question, mark `triaged`, leave open.

Why per-item: untriaged items accumulate silently between passes; labelling is cheapest while the context is fresh.

Key rules from the reference file: triage tags 5 dimensions plus a derived priority (importance is encoded as `severity/*`); conform to the project's existing scheme (`gh label list` first). Parallelize for ~20+ items (chunks of 10-15, one `Agent` each, cap ~6/wave). Pick work in priority order, not interest order — PRs usually outrank issues; for issues sort by priority -> urgency -> impact -> unblocks-others -> effort, surface top 3-5 with "why now". While working an issue, file follow-ups as separate triaged issues — don't expand scope. Proactively close gaps (clarifying-question comments, edit issues to capture discovered context — never overwrite the asker's words). End every pass with counts + a focus list.

## Task Management

- Use Claude Code's built-in task system (TaskCreate/TaskList/TaskUpdate). Plan first, verify the plan, then track progress through tasks. Explain changes with a high-level summary at each step. Capture lessons in auto-memory after corrections.

## Git Workflow

Full rules in `~/.claude/git-workflow.md` — **read before every commit, PR, or push**. Headline:

- **Conventional commits**: `type(scope): subject`, imperative, ≤72 chars. Never mention Anthropic/Claude. Never use heredoc-based `git commit -m` — `Write` a fresh uniquely-named file under `/tmp/claude/`, commit with `git commit -F`, delete it after.
- **Small atomic commits**: one concern each, independently revertable.
- **⚠️ Mandatory pre-commit review loop — 3 clean passes**: read `git diff --cached` and check the five review dimensions (§1). Fix in the same changeset, never via follow-up commits. **Run this review on Opus as comprehensively as possible — CodeRabbit's lens is the floor, not the ceiling** (architecture, type design, silent failures, test coverage, security, comment accuracy, performance, convention fit; fan out the `pr-review-toolkit:*` agents for substantial diffs). Goal: land clean for CR AND humans on the first pass. Catching a finding locally costs one pass; catching it after review costs a push + review wait + fix commit + another round. Shipping it well the first time is much faster.
- **Post-push CI watcher**: after every `git push`, enumerate all workflow runs for the pushed commit and launch one background `Agent` per run (`run_in_background: true`) named `ci-watch-<short-sha>-<workflow-slug>`. Each fetches failed logs and **fixes failures autonomously**. Coordinate via the `git-push` lock before pushing fixes. Escalate only for decisions.
- **PRs**: ≤400 lines, one concern, conventional-commit title, feature branch `type/short-description`. Never `--no-verify`.
- **Post-PR review loop**: after `gh pr create`, trigger CodeRabbit (`@coderabbitai review`), spawn `cr-watch-<pr-#>` to await the bot review (60-120s polling, soft-handle 429s), triage suggestions (actionable / dismiss-with-justification / batch-nitpick), push fixes per the pre-commit loop, then re-ping `@coderabbitai review` and loop until a clean review (**never** `@coderabbitai resolve` or hand-resolving threads to silence the bot), then `merge-watch-<pr-#>` awaits **human merge** (no self-merge by default), then deploy + verify (Chrome MCP for UI, `curl` for API, `terraform plan` for IaC), then post a recommendation-to-close on the originating issue and **file new issues for out-of-scope follow-ups**. Full lifecycle in `git-workflow.md`.

## Session Handoff

When ending a session or running low on context, leave a summary so the next session can continue without re-reading the conversation:

```
## Session Handoff — [date]

**Done**: completed work with file paths or commit refs
**In progress**: what's partially done and where it was left off
**Blocked**: anything waiting on the user, an external dep, or a decision
**Gotchas**: anything surprising that will affect next steps
**Next steps**: concrete first action for the next session
```
