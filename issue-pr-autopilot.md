# Issue -> PR Autopilot (scheduled, per-repo)

A continuous delivery loop driven by GitHub issue labels. A scheduled **remote**
Claude Code agent (created via the `schedule` skill / `RemoteTrigger`) fires on a
cron, opens PRs for unlabelled issues, and stamps labels that act as the state
machine. The label *is* the dedup guard.

This file is the source of truth for the per-repo config and the routine prompt
(`issue-pr-autopilot.prompt.md`, same directory). It composes existing machinery,
it does not duplicate it:

- Selection / triage rubric -> `triage.md` (work selection + label rubric)
- Plan -> worktree -> implement -> review -> PR -> `CLAUDE.md`, `worktrees.md`,
  `coding-standards.md`, `conventions.md`
- Commit/PR hygiene + post-PR CR loop -> `git-workflow.md`
- Driving an opened PR to merge-ready -> the `pr-iterate` flow (`commands/` / skills)

> **Runtime caveat (load-bearing):** remote scheduled agents run in Anthropic's
> cloud, isolated, with their **own git checkout and zero access to a developer's
> `~/.claude`**. The design solves this with **two git sources**: the target repo
> **and** `LeanerCloud/dotclaude` (this repo). The cold agent reads the full
> guideline set (git-workflow, triage, coding-standards, conventions, worktrees,
> pr-iterate) from the `dotclaude` checkout, plus the target repo's own
> `CLAUDE.md`/`CONTRIBUTING.md` for repo-specifics. The routine prompt also inlines
> the global hard constraints as a backstop. Keep `dotclaude` and each target
> repo's committed conventions current.

## The label state machine

| Issue state | Label(s) | Meaning | Loop action |
|---|---|---|---|
| fresh / unlabelled | (none) | no PR yet | **eligible** - open a PR, then add `pr-created` |
| PR in flight | `pr-created` | a PR exists (open or merged) | skip (dedup) |
| PR merged | `pr-created` + `pr-merged` | delivered | skip; reconcile only |
| abandoned PR | `pr-created` (manual) | prior PR closed unmerged | skip (operator handles manually) |

- `pr-created` (color `1D76DB`): a PR has been opened for this issue.
- `pr-merged` (color `0E8A16`): the issue's PR has been merged.

Labels are created on first fire if missing.

## Per-fire phases

0. **Preflight (cheap gate).** Resolve repo + login. Ensure both labels exist.
   Count open issues lacking `pr-created`. If 0 and nothing to reconcile, exit.
1. **Reconcile (cheap, first).** For each `pr-created` and not `pr-merged` issue,
   find its linked PR (closing-keyword / `(#N)` / title-mirror in a PR body, since
   CUDly PRs target a non-default base so auto-close does not fire). If MERGED, add
   `pr-merged`. Never remove `pr-created`.
1b. **Advance open PRs (no cap).** For each `pr-created` and not `pr-merged` issue
   whose linked PR is still OPEN, drive it one CR iteration closer to merge-ready
   via the pr-iterate flow: pull CR signal, triage findings (fix / skip with
   justification / file follow-up), apply fixes minimally, push. Before re-pinging
   CR: verify a live `cr-watch-<pr-#>` agent exists; spawn one if missing. Only
   then re-ping `@coderabbitai review`. Process ALL qualifying PRs this fire;
   defer only if CR is rate-limited. Do NOT self-merge.
2. **Select (capped).** Open issues without `pr-created`, filtered to eligible,
   ranked by `triage.md` (priority -> urgency -> impact -> unblocks -> effort).
   Take the top N = per-fire cap.
3. **Implement each.** Plan; branch off the repo's base branch; implement to repo
   standards; five-dimension self-review; conventional commits via `git commit -F`;
   open a PR with `Closes #<issue>`; **strip any auto-injected Claude footer**;
   **mirror the issue's triage rubric onto the PR**; add `pr-created` to the issue;
   spawn `cr-watch-<pr-#>` background agent AND trigger `@coderabbitai review` as
   one indivisible action (trigger without watcher is a defect per
   `git-workflow.md` §"Post-PR review loop").
4. **Hand off.** A human merges (no self-merge). The next fire's Phase 1 stamps
   `pr-merged`.

## Per-repo config

| Repo | Base branch | Eligibility | New-PR cap/fire | CR-advance cap/fire | Cadence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `LeanerCloud/CUDly` | `feat/multicloud-web-frontend` | any `triaged` issue except `type/question`, `status/blocked`, `status/needs-info` | 3 | none (all open PRs) | hourly (`0 * * * *` UTC) | disabled (pending validation) |
| other `LeanerCloud/*` | repo default unless stated | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | pending |
| `cristim/*` | repo default | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | pending |

## Cost controls

- Cheap preflight gate so quiet backlogs cost ~nothing.
- Per-fire cap bounds new PRs (and downstream CR loops) per run.
- The `schedule` API floor is **1 hour** (`*/30` is rejected). Frequency x cap is
  the spend lever.

## Operating the routine

- Manage via the `schedule` skill (`RemoteTrigger`: list/get/create/update/run).
  You **cannot delete** via API; use https://claude.ai/code/routines.
- **Always test first**: create disabled, do one `run`, confirm the cloud env can
  clone + implement + open a PR + edit labels, then `enable`.
- **Kill switch**: update `{enabled:false}` or toggle in the routines UI.
- Environment: Default (`anthropic_cloud`). Model: `claude-sonnet-4-6`.

## Known runtime quirks (observed)

- The CCR runtime auto-appends a `Generated by Claude Code` / claude.ai session
  footer to PR bodies. This violates the no-Claude-mention rule, so the routine
  strips it post-create (Phase 3). If it re-appears after edit, disable it at the
  environment level.
- Untracked files under a developer's `~/.claude` (which is the `dotclaude`
  checkout) get wiped by sync. Commit anything that must persist (this file is an
  example).
